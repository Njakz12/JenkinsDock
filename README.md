In this project i decided to run jenkins and sonarqube as a conntainer for the following reasons:

- Official Docker images for Jenkins and SonarQube are available, making it easy to get started without manual installation.

- You can run Jenkins, SonarQube, and other tools on a single server, reducing infrastructure costs.

- Running Jenkins and SonarQube as containers provides isolation, portability, simplified setup, resource efficiency, and easy integration with CI/CD pipelines. Itâ€™s a modern, efficient, and scalable approach to managing DevOps tools.
